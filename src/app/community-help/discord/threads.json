        "content": "Hi, I am new to Payload and starting to learn my way around the codebase. Enjoying it so far!\n\nThis post explains my scenario but basically asks \"Are there any existing examples of replacing the relationship field in `Edit` views with a custom component that can get me started?\"\n\nI have followed the method in this thread to populate images within custom `Cell` components as pictured in the attachments.\nhttps://discordapp.com/channels/967097582721572934/1041362545501548624\n\nI would like to create a similar component for relationship types in `Edit` view to replace the dropdown list item (last image attachment).\n\nAm I correct in thinking that I will need to target changing the `SingleValue` component? Here in the source:\nhttps://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/src/admin/components/forms/field-types/Relationship/select-components/SingleValue/index.tsx\n\nOr are there multiple components that I will have to target? \nFor example, does the `SingleValue` component specify the selections only when the drop down `DocumentDrawer` is open but there is a different component I need to target for when it is closed?\nIf this is the scenario of Payload - I would have to target the `Relationship` component in addition to `SingleValue` ?\nhttps://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/src/admin/components/forms/field-types/Relationship/index.tsx\n\nAnd in my definition for the collection that makes use of this relationship - the field object will look something like this if my new component is called `ImageTitleRelationshipField` ?\n\n```\n{\n    name: \"competitorOne\",\n    type: \"relationship\",\n    relationTo: [\"artworks\"],\n    admin: {\n        components: {\n            Cell: ImageTitleCell,\n            Field: ImageTitleRelationshipField\n        },\n    },\n},\n```\nI guess I am asking - what is the best approach? and are there any existing examples of replacing the relationship field in `Edit` views with a custom component that can get me started?",

Looking at the `Relationship` field source code (https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/src/admin/components/forms/field-types/Relationship/index.tsx) it doesn't seem very maintainable in the long term to try swapping this whole field out with all its dependencies... If I am correct in my reading of the source what I am actually interested in is changing the usage of `props` within `ReactSelect` component...in my case for the `SingleValue` variant. \n\nI'll have to do more thinking about this caveat over the next week or so when I have the time. I'll update this thread when I can. \n\nFor now I could categorize this potential issue in broader terms by saying: Without any concept of an attached featured image per collection item, content editors do not have a way of rapidly identifying a target item when attaching as a relationship via the existing `ReactSelect` UI if they are not sure about its name because the UI offers text only. Any alternative suggestions for working around this issue would be appreciated 🙂 .",

I watched them live as I refreshed the page etc. Nothing logged.\n- Copied the URL that the graphql playground is trying to connect to into my browser address bar. I get a JSON response asking me to provide a query string, as expected.\n- Using Postman, made an empty POST request to the URL in the above step. Identical result.\n\nOther info:\n- The graphql schema does not load. It just shows a loading icon and then logs another 500 error to the browser console (I assume as it retries)\n- The docs tab exhibits the same behaviour",

My steps:\n- Grab the query that my playground was making,\n- Post it to the endpoint using Postman\n\nThis actually gave me a decent error:\n`{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Type ContactForm_ContactForm must define one or more fields.\"}]}`\n\nLooking into my code, my ContactForm block was as so:\n```ts\nexport const contactForm: Block = {\n  slug: 'contactForm',\n  fields: [\n    blockFields({\n      name: 'contactForm',\n      fields: [\n        {\n          type: 'ui',\n          name: 'contactForm',\n          admin: {\n            components: {\n              Field: ContactFormLabel,\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    }),\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nNote, the only field is the `ui` field, displaying a custom element. This block requires no fields as it gets it's config from a global.\n\n\nI updated the block as so, note the addition of a very basic text field. Rebuild and deployed and now my GQL Playground works.\n```ts\nexport const contactForm: Block = {\n  slug: 'contactForm',\n  fields: [\n    blockFields({\n      name: 'contactForm',\n      fields: [\n        { name: 'title', type: 'text', required: true },\n        {\n          type: 'ui',\n          name: 'contactForm',\n          admin: {\n            components: {\n              Field: ContactFormLabel,\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    }),\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nIs this intended behaviour? I would ideally like this block to contain no elements besides the `ui` element. Thanks",

For anything big enough to be above the free usage limits you should be paying anyway... but that combo would likely still be a relatively cheap setup.\n\nIf you use NextJS and the `next/image` component for the front-end rendering of the content you can turn off the optimisation in Payload and let your NextJS app handle it via a Cloudinary image loader. Or, if you host in Vercel, you can let Vercel do the optimisation (but that would be expensive if you go over their quotas).",

The only thing here is, it’s a circular reference so you need a way to break the chain. I would likely create another field `lastModifiedBySelf` and then check the user id on the request with the id on `originalDoc`, if they match set the new checkbox and clear the relationship, else set the relationship.\n\nSee all arguments for beforeChange hook here https://payloadcms.com/docs/hooks/collections#beforechange",

After a few draft/publish cycles, I've this this issue where no documents appear in the list. Digging into the console,  I get a 500 when the admin tries to hit `api/insights?locale=en&depth=0&draft=true`\n\nLooking at the response from that call, it has an error object, containing: `{\"message\":\"PlanExecutor error during aggregation :: caused by :: Failed to parse objectId 'test' in $convert with no onError value: Invalid string length for parsing to OID, expected 24 but found 4\"}`\n\nNow, `test` was the id I had set for my test object. It seems like it's trying to parse it as an OID, which I assume means it thinks the id field should be payload's default format, instead of a custom text field, as configured.\n\nEven more interestingly, if I delete `draft=true` off the end, and hit `https://payload-cms.f4s.com/api/insights?locale=en&depth=0`, it works, and returns a correct response.\n\n`{\"docs\":[{\"id\":\"test\",\"name\":\"Test\",\"motivations\":[],\"_status\":\"draft\",\"createdAt\":\"2023-01-16T05:53:40.668Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2023-01-16T05:53:40.668Z\"}],\"totalDocs\":1,\"limit\":10,\"totalPages\":1,\"page\":1,\"pagingCounter\":1,\"hasPrevPage\":false,\"hasNextPage\":false,\"prevPage\":null,\"nextPage\":null}`\n\nThis is running on an AWS docker instance, so it's a bit of a pain to introspect the MongoDB (unreachable outside the AWS cluster), but that's my next step.

Essentially I need to put a custom button (either in the list or the document edit screen) that when clicked, creates a new entry in a different collection based on the data in current document. What's the best way to do that? \n\nI've created the button with a UI field and tried using the local API to do this, but I get an error `payload__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__.default.create is not a function`. I think I'm not using it correctly, is this designed to only work with hooks? Should I use graphql instead? An entirely different approach?\n\nCode below for the ui field custom component... any help/examples appreciated. Thanks!\n\n```import React from \"react\";\nimport { useDocumentInfo } from \"payload/components/utilities\";\nimport payload from \"payload\";\n\nasync function createStagePage(docData) {\n  await payload.create({\n    collection: \"stagePage\",\n    data: {\n      title: \"testTitle\",\n    },\n  });\n}\ntype Props = { label: string };\nconst StageField: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {\n  const docinfo = useDocumentInfo();\n  const clickHandler = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    const returnObj = {\n      fields: docinfo.collection.fields,\n      id: docinfo.id,\n    };\n    createStagePage(returnObj);\n  };\n  return <button onClick={clickHandler}>Content Stage</button>;\n};\nexport default StageField;```",

Is there a way to mark a top-level field as optional when the types are generated?\n\n- I haven't been able to find a way to mark a collection-level field as optional (i.e. when it's not nested in a group of other fields). This optional field would ideally render out on the admin UI initially as a plus button you have to add, and the generated type would be optional, similar to `field?: {...subFields}`. Is there an obvious way to do this that I'm missing, or is this not possible/implemented yet?\n- Currently I'm having to include a checkbox labeled as \"Include <field name>\" and normalize it down the road which is annoying and hard to manage. This generates to  `field: {...subFields}; includeField: boolean`\n\n\n2. Are there plans to smarten up the type-generation to take into account conditions in the admin UI? I ran into a situation where a field is being replaced by another via a condition in the admin UI, but this behavior isn't reflected in the types. I know it would be very difficult to determine the behavior of an arbitrary function, but for a simple boolean check in the conditional I feel like it should be possible to determine the expected behavior from that and generate types accordingly.\n\nOther than that, this feature has been very helpful and a life saver, so keep up the fantastic work!\n\nIf I'm missing something obvious please let me know, thanks!",

        "content": "Hey folks, I've been trying to build text alignment into my RTE (like I'm sure a lot of you have tried to do as well) and I'm wanting to share some of the stuff I've done so far. Just a disclaimer, this is currently working in a very limited capacity, the UI is glitchy, and the only thing is achieves so far is mutating the target node to have alignment as an option. I have trawled through every CMS project on the Payload Github to identify key areas for developing a custom text alignment element. Here are my findings so far;\n\n- Text Alignment should be done using an Element rather than a Leaf, this is because leafs alter their child elements directly, whereas Elements affect a block. So if you have a h4 tag with Bold and Underline leaves, you want to add alignment to the entire text block rather than the normal text, bold and underline leaves.\n- Text Alignment should not be treated as a unique element, it is an extension of the current node. According to this post - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14127632 - the author of Slate states that you should add custom data to the nodes, rather than setting the 'type' property of the node (like what happens currently when applying h1, h2, h3...)\n- When attempting to use Slatejs or Slate-react directly inside Element or Button code, YOU DO NOT NEED TO NPM INSTALL THESE PACKAGES. Instead, using the version used by payload. These packages can be accessed from `payload/node_modules/slate` and `payload/node_modules/slate-react`",

It doesn't actually change anything in the Editor UI as for some reason the element re-render doesn't seem to get triggered. Because it doesn't re-trigger, I am unable to actually make changes to way the text is displayed on the editor. HOWEVER, rest assured that the change has actually happened, so json object passed to your website front-end WILL show this change (big win). Obviously this isn't workable from a general user perspective as the UI appears to be unresponsive in Payload. But it's a start!\n\nSo guys, I have a baseline.

But I have two followup questions\nfirst: How do I add objects to myArray? \nsecond: to go a bit deeper in setting values in myArray. You suggest retrieving the group field via `const groupField = useFormField(groupPath)`. How to go on? I still don't understand how to get the nested fields from there. My approach from the point of my understanding would be to use the array path to get the array field. then get the length (is this possible?) and push them in a string field array (`myTextFields.push(useField('${arrayPath}.${index}.myTextFieldName')`) to set and get myText fields.",

I see the login page on port 3000, but it doesn't actually create the user. The login screen provides no error messaging. On the terminal that is running payload there are no error messages, and the service is running even after trying to create user so it did not crash.\n\nMy environment:\n\n- I use Gitpod which is a Cloud Development Environment that essentially is a container with a VSCode GUI. This means I'm using linux.\n- I am attempting to run payload and mongo through the dockercompose that gets generated but I've also tried running payload on local with mongo on a container.\n- Mongo IS running. I can access it from mongosh from within the payload container and from local into the mongo container\n- Mongo databases active are [ admin, config, local, test ]. AFAIK these are all default to Mongo.\n\nMy questions:\n\n- Where does Payload output logging? Or how do I get it to. In the payload project dir I do not see any logging.  Is there logging in the payload node module? I could not find it. If there isn't built in loggin, is there a tool you suggest for payload?\n\n- The Docs are very sparse (unless I missed it) on how payload utilizes mongodb. I can't tell if the uri needs to have a db like mongo://localhost:27017/payload for the db to be created in mongo on init. Does it just use the default test db if no db name is specified? The create app cli does not generate that in the uri so it's unclear. Do I need to have the db already created and initalized for payload to use before I create? I've tried all these different ways of setting up the db but still the same problem.\n\nI'm new to payload, typescript and mongodb so it's the bermuda triangle for me right now and I'm lost.",

Some of the below is expended further in various docs, discord and GitHub threads. \n\n1. Server code needs to be in its own file and aliased by webpack, not the package but the file  itself.\n2. On the collection that is being used to auth the admin panel, pass in the passport strategy as documented by payload\n3. Set `disableLocalStrategy= true` **This turns off all payload Auth functionality for that collection (login etc…)**\n4. Using the endpoints property on the collection you can create a custom route. For example you can recreate /login \n5. On the UI pass in a custom component using before or after dashboard. This component should be the form to post login/sign up info to your route. \n6. Order of operations are \n     - your strategy function is called. whatever is returned will be accessible by the endpoint route\n     - endpoint api route is called in req.user there is the data previously returned by the strategy.\n7. In the endpoint api route you can access your payload instance to do look ups, create etc\n    - for example… for login, I do a lookup based on email… since it’s password less flow (magic link)\n8. Then create the session yourself using a JWT. The shape of the cookie needs to be an object with the fields collection, e-mail and payload ID set as a httponly. The discussion I linked about has useful sudo code. You also have to set res.user to have the same object as the cookie.\n9. The cookie name must be the same payload expects. The payload instance has the prefix -> `${payload.config.cookiePrefix}-token`\n10. Visit admin and 🚀 \n\nLastly remember to recreate logout, refresh, etc… for your cookie synced with your strategy provider",

Iterate over all the documents again, iterate over the localized fields as before, update the docs with the strings in each of the N locales taken from the N PO files. This will be using the strings in the default locale as keys to look up the corresponding strings in all the other locales. Use a gettext implementation to deal with all the PO/POT files, there are a few different implementations in npm, not sure yet which would be the best to go with. https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gettext and https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node-gettext might be a good place to start",

I believe you already have some support for localizing the admin UI, but none yet for the content.\n\nThis is what I have so far (not everything is working yet):\n\n* Given a collection config, pull out the paths to all localized text fields in the config, including fields nested inside groups, arrays, etc. Naturally, this will be extended to handle multiple collections, perhaps all. I'm looking for direction on how to best configure the behaviour of the tool here.\n\n* Given a document from this collection, pull out all the string values of all the localized text fields in the document. For each value, I also get the path to where the value come from, e.g. the string \"The south Pacific\" came from collectionX.documentY.groupZ.fieldW.\n\n* Given the set of string values, write the strings to file in POT format\n\nThe work flow from here would then be to send the POT file off to translation, getting back a PO file for each language, where those PO files map from strings like \"The south Pacific\" to \"Der Südpazifik\". PO/POT files are widely used, there are lots of tools for managing and manipulating them, see getText. Now we would need to choose a getText implementation to facilitate the process of looking up translations from the source language to each translated language. There are a couple of different implementations to choose from. I have not decided, so I am mocking out the getText() function in the folloing.\n\n* Given a function getText() which maps from the source language to each translated language, and given a set of documents in the collection, look up all values in all documents and save all localized fields.",

Your docs are pretty thin on this, this page https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/localization covers how to pull localized data, but not how to update it.\n* Which getText implementation to use, e.g. https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gettext\n* Consider whether PO/POT is the correct file format or whether there are others that are better suited for translating strings longer than a paragraph.\n* Once we start looking at the code, perhaps there are smarter ways to code this, I don't know the Payload codebase well.",

Suppose you have to translate something from a richtext field:\n`<p> Something <bold> bold </bold> and <a href=\"\">link</a></p>`\nAre you able to parameterize it enough to make it work with this for example?\n\nI don't want a half-baked feature. If is supported, then we can move forward. I'm imagining there will be a place to upload  translation files that goes to a special collection that has hooks to do the document creation/updating using the local api.\n\nWe have to decide if this is a core feature or a plugin. I'm leaning towards an official plugin under payloadcms/plugin-*whatever-we-call-it*.\nI'll do some learning and reply to your specific questions tomorrow.",

Since this is about translating *content* only, it seems to me that the use cases for needing to handle strings with placeholders, plurals and such is not there. Perhaps I am overlooking something? That *does* need to be handled in the localization of the admin interfaces, and also any other custom React component that can be build in Payload to support any particular document collection, but that is a separate thing.",

Our toolchain consists of lingui https://lingui.dev/ that handles exporting strings from JSX to POT and importing the translated strings from PO and making the strings appear in the correct locale in the app. Lingui contains a `<Trans>` component so we can flag in the JSX that a particular string should be translated by having `<Text><Trans>This is the string</Trans><Text>` . It can also handle placeholders  like so we can translate `\"City - \\\"{city}\\\"` to `\"Ville – « {city} »\"`.There are several alternatives to lingui https://react.libhunt.com/js-lingui-alternatives We also use Weblate https://weblate.org/en/ to manage the translation of UX strings, great for keeping track of which strings are new/changed in each release so we know what strings to send for translation.\n\nThis new plugin to Payload would do for content roughly what lingui does for code, with a feature set that is appropriate for the needs of translating content, which i *think* is quite a bit simpler than for code.",

Sorting by most viewed, most liked or popular is out of the question here. The only two solutions I found so far require the client to upload the recipes in the one specific order they want (meaning they cannot rearrange it) - or me manually sorting it in middleware having to adjust the code every time a new recipe is added or the order changes.",

If I query for /api/pages?draft=true , only the most recently edited page shows. The problem is that the dashboard queries for draft=true automatically, so my list of pages only ever shows the most recent one, although the others are there. If I search for missing pages, I see some, but the results don't make sense (e.g. search for \"Imprint\" shows me the home page). I recently enabled localization project wide, maybe there is an issue with the index?",

I'm trying to generate and encode a QR code of the Product's data into the uploaded image before it is uploaded. I've used both beforeValidate and beforeChange collection hooks to replace the buffer provided in req.files.file.data but the uploaded image is still the original image that the user selected. In the following code I generate a QR code using the new Product's data, and use that QR's buffer and the buffer of the image the user wants to upload to add that QR into the image, and then return the buffer that is the final image result. I can confirm my QR functions are working properly with those buffer inputs.\n\n```js\nimport { CollectionBeforeValidateHook } from \"payload/types\";\nimport { addQRToImg, encodeQR } from \"../util\";\nimport jsonpack from \"jsonpack\";\n\nconst encodeImageWithQR: CollectionBeforeValidateHook = async ({\n    data,\n    req,\n    operation,\n    originalDoc,\n}) => {\n    const uploadedImgBuffer = req.files.file.data;\n\n    const productDataBuffer = await encodeQR(jsonpack.pack(data));\n    const updatedImgBuffer = await addQRToImg(productDataBuffer, uploadedImgBuffer);\n\n    req.files.file.data = updatedImgBuffer;\n    \n    return data;\n};\n\nexport default encodeImageWithQR;\n```\n\nAny ideas? Am I using the wrong hook? Thank you!",

You could implement this with a UI field if you'd like however a better alternative could be the following - using 3 fields:\n- Add a radio button to determine how to populate the field `[\"byGroup\", \"bySelection\"]`\n- When `byGroup` is selected - conditionally render a select with groups. Then you'd need to wire up a `beforeChange` hook to fetch and fill the relationship field with the ids of the ones in that group.\n- When an individual is selected: show the relationship field.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Mostly straightforward but the trickiest part is the media files since those are handled drastically different (better) in payload.

Each app is hosted on its own domain. I want each of these apps to have a CMS powered by Payload CMS. Note that I do have a shared UI and a shared DB set up in the Turborepo. \n\nSOLUTIONS: \nHere's two architectural options I'm considering, and I would like some feedback as to which one y'all think would be the best solution. \n\n1) I can integrate Payload CMS into *each* Next.js app such that when a client needs to access their CMS, they would remain in their own domain and within the context of their app. \n- I can access the shared UI and DB such that the UI will remain consistent across all clients' CMSs. \n- This option also makes it seemingly easier to package the CMS and the site together if I ever needed these codebases to not be in the monorepo any longer. \n\n2) I can create *one* Payload CMS app (carefully handling access control for each client organization) for all of the clients to manage their content. \n- This would make the traffic to the client's site not include any CMS traffic. \n- This does however mean that clients would be redirected to a different site (my in-house CMS) to manage their content. \n- Would this affect my ability to implement a preview feature? \n- I am considering this option because if I were to make changes to my CMS later on, there would be only one single Payload CMS to manage and update. \n- I also like the idea of being able to manage all of my users across all clientele in one panel. \n\nAny thoughts?  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my thoughts and suggested approaches....",

This would make it easier to package the CMS and site together if needed, and allows you to use the shared UI and DB for consistency across all client CMSs. However, it may require more maintenance and updates if changes need to be made to the CMS for each individual app.\n\nOption 2, creating one Payload CMS app for all clients, would allow you to manage all users and content in one panel, but may require more complex access control and redirect clients to a different site to manage their content. This option would also separate the CMS traffic from the client's site traffic, which may be beneficial. However, it may be harder to implement a preview feature, and would require more maintenance and updates if changes need to be made to the CMS.\n\nUltimately, the best solution depends on your specific requirements and priorities. Some things to consider include the importance of preview feature, the need for consistent UI across all clients, ease of maintenance and updates, and the level of access control required.",

Instead, use another field named  `mimeType`  or similar, then in an  `afterChange` hook on your collection, fetch the full doc and save its mime-type to that field. This way it only makes the request once when the document is created or updated, and that data is now passed through to your condition as expected. What do you think?",

Essentially it creates a new version of a page that content editors can work on long term (for large overhaul changes), while the original page can still be worked on (edited and republished) normally. Content-staged pages are shown in a separate section in the UI, and can be worked on independently of the original version. Then when the long term edits are complete and approved, the editor can publish the \"content staged\" page, which effectively overwrites whatever version the page is currently in. As a bonus, it also allows for batch releases, where you can select multiple content-staged pages and publish them together.",

Then being able to access that version through graphql similar to how drafts are accessed now... maybe instead of a boolean it would look something like this: `{Pages(draft:\"staging\") {...}}` Ideally there would also be some sort of UI geared toward managing/publishing these as well. \n\nI've just started looking at Payload last week so still exploring the possibility of using a duplicate document to achieve this in some way.\n\nHappy to discuss with the team to clarify the use case, if you're looking for input.",

For context, I am using ISG with Next 13's App Directory, with a cache limit of 10 seconds while I make updates to the site for testing. I am using MongoDB Atlas, running Payload inside a Docker Container on Google Cloud Run.\n\nI have found that when refreshing the page on my Next 13 app in quick succession, it causes Payload to freakout and hide all of the pages in my Pages collection. The data is still in Mongodb, and additionally, I can retrieve them by going to my global navbar which uses a relationship to my pages. I can then select the edit button in the relationship dropdown and save each page. This brings them all back, but it is going to be a pain to do when I have over 50 pages on my website.\n\nHas anyone else had this issue?\n\nI ran in the versions migration script, maybe it's an error with the new versions not playing nicely.",

It would be nice if the access hooks took in an array instead or maybe if it could define an OR/AND combination of permission checks which would make it easier to extend.\n\nedit:\nI landed on something like this, where the extension function takes in the user from the request (might update it to take the whole request in the future) so that I can attach custom extensions where needed, so that customers can interact with specific fields or parts of the API\n\n```ts\nexport const hasRoleOrSelf =\n  (role: User['role'], extension?: extensionFunction): Access<any, User> =>\n  ({ req: { user } }) => {\n    if (user) {\n      if (extension) {\n        const validatedExtension = extension(user)\n        if (typeof validatedExtension === 'boolean') return validatedExtension\n      }\n\n      const userRole = user?.role\n\n      if (userRole === role) return true\n      if (PriorityMap[userRole] >= PriorityMap[role]) return true\n\n      return {\n        id: {\n          equals: user.id,\n        },\n      }\n    }\n\n    return false\n  }\n```",

Using the autosave feature, the content on the preview page should be updated every 2 seconds. \n\nOne unsolved question is how to actually refresh the page content: I could let the page query the content every 2 seconds, or maybe set up a websocket connection to the payload express app? Since I haven't done anything similar before, I'd love to hear if anyone thinks this will work, or if there are better/simpler ways to implement this.",
